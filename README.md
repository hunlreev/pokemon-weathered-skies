# Welcome to Pokemon Weathered Skies!

## About the Rom Hack

Welcome to the Metoria Region! There is quite a lot of weather here, and the Pokemon seem to undergo changes that make them stronger in certain types of weather... that's where you come in! You are to explore the region and figure out why this is happening, and to make new discoveries with your new pal - Castform! Explore multiple areas in the region, and experience all sorts of weather! Collect 8 gym badges, but be warned - they know how to use weather effects to their advantage. Each badge will allow you to progress further into the game. Explore 13 new Towns and Cities and 6 new places to explore.

## Disclaimer

Since is the first rom hack I have ever worked on, it is worth noting that a lot of the cool features you would come to expect with a modern rom hack will not be here. The game is a base FireRed rom hack with generation 3 Pokemon and all of the base functionality that came with the FireRed game. Nothing new has been added because, again, this is my first rom hack. This has taken an exceptional amount of work to do to get a very basic rom hack going with a new map, custom story, and custom music. I hope you can appreciate this rom hack for what it is and enjoy it. Let me know if you encounter bugs or any issues to me.
